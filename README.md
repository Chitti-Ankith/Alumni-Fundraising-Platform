# Alumni Fundraising Platform

Tech Clubs and Students who are working on technical projects often lack sufficient funding to
carry out their plans. The government isnâ€™t coming to the aid of private colleges anytime soon.
However, Alumni who want to contribute to their Alma Mater might come to the rescue.
We intended to create a Web application that will allow Bits Pilani students to obtain funding for their
projects from Alumni.

Functionality:

1) The Students can put up their project ideas for the perusal of the Alumni after having
consulted with Professors regarding their feasibility.
2) Each project will have a detailed description, proposed plan of work, timeline of work and
stretch goals. The students can update the page with the current progress of the project.
3) Profile of all the alumni will be maintained along with the history of their respective
contributions.
4) Depending on the amount of money a particular alum has donated, their names will
appear on the list of top donors for the respective project. Over time, particularly
generous donors might be rewarded with tokens of appreciation.(For example, The
product incorporating some identifier relating to the Alum/ Stocks in case of venture etc.)
5) The payment system will be a convincing placebo for security reasons.

Implemented a Full-stack MERN app with authentication using passport and JWTs.

This project uses the following technologies:

- [React](https://reactjs.org) and [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) for frontend
- [Express](http://expressjs.com/) and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) for the backend
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for the database
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/basics/usagewithreact) for state management between React components

## Quick Start

```javascript
